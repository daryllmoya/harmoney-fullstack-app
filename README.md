# Puppy Adoption Web Application

This is a simple web application that allows users to view and adopt puppies. The project consists of two parts: the frontend built with Next.js and the backend API built with Nest.js.

## Features

- View a list of available puppies for adoption with their names, breeds, ages, and descriptions.
- Filter and search for puppies based on breed, age, size, and gender.
- View detailed information about a puppy, including personality traits, medical history, and adoption requirements.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed (at least Node.js v14.x)
- Yarn (optional, you can use npm if preferred)
- Docker (optional, for deployment)

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/puppy-adoption.git

# Build the Docker image from the root of the project
docker build -t puppy-adoption .
```
